## 🗄️ Database Schemas

SOLAHANA uses MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose object modeling:

* **`users`**: Manages account credentials, bcrypt password hashes, roles (`user`, `advisor`, `admin`), active states, and login timestamps.
* **`consultations`**: Stores client advisory bookings, preferred date/time, financial goals, consultation mode, meeting links, and advisor internal notes.
* **`newsletters`**: Manages email subscriber lists for wealth insights.
* **`blogs`** *(Coming Soon)*: Articles and market research commentary.
* **`savedcalculations`** *(Coming Soon)*: Saved client calculation snapshots.

---

## 🔒 Security Architecture

- **JWT Authentication**: Tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies and supported via Bearer authorization headers.
- **Bcrypt Hashing**: Passwords salted and hashed using `12` rounds before database persistence.
- **Zod Validation**: Input sanitization blocking invalid enum values, malformed emails, and past dates.
- **HTTP Security Headers**: `helmet` enabled to protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, clickjacking).
- **CORS Protection**: Origin whitelist configured for production domains and local development ports.
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
